[61.69%] In the early years of their marriage, the couple faced several personal setbacks.
--------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
[61.62%] as the husbandman of that day had.

         The direction that the craft is traveling with respect to the true wind (the wind direction and speed over the surface – VT ) is called the point of sail.

[65.62%] Given suitable automatic control over the traversing head, any combination of wind patterns is possible.
--------------------------------------------------
[65.62%] Such a pattern is produced by a helical wind, again often followed by a final circumferential layer.
--------------------------------------------------
[65.49%] Although weather conditions were relatively homogeneous across sites, wind directions tended to be more variable across sites during the morning hours, the period during which directional movement begins.

[65.44%] A wind whipped up.

--------------------------------------------------
[64.49%] The progress of the vessel, which is usually under easy sail during the time of cutting in, keeps the whale from drifting out at right angles from the side; though, in most cases, the head is kept in its appropriate position by a small rope made fast aft.

         Roughly speaking the CCS conjecture is as follows:
--------------------------------------------------
[72.93%] We determine, $c^2_s$ by employing a method reported in [@gupta].
--------------------------------------------------
[71.93%] It is that the arbitrary constant $C$ is determined here to be real and nonnegative.
--------------------------------------------------
[71.67%] Let s(c) = -c**2.
--------------------------------------------------
[71.29%] Then $\mathcal{L}_{m}-D_{m}=\mathcal{L}_{m}=\mathcal{L}(C_{m})$, which implies that $C_{m}$ is preserved as a tSCC in the complementary digraph $G^{\star}$.
--------------------------------------------------
[71.11%] Let c(q) = -6*q**2 + 2*q.
--------------------------------------------------
[70.60%] Let $$\label{constant-c-r}
--------------------------------------------------
[70.57%] We sum over all possible $1$-column vectors $\mathbf{c}$ and obtain the constant term of $$\begin{
--------------------------------------------------
[70.56%] Let $c_i$ be the number of condensed identity states which contain $i$ distinct identity states.
--------------------------------------------------
[70.53%] This is a conjecture from [@GGOR Remark 5.17] which we answer with:
--------------------------------------------------
[70.39%] We have verified the conjecture computationally with the GAP [@GAP] package LOOPS [@LOOPS] for $p=
--------------------------------------------------
[70.27%] Let c be s(9).
--------------------------------------------------
[70.22%] Determine c(s(b)).
--------------------------------------------------
[70.18%] Whenever we write $$A \ll_{p_1, \ldots, p_k} B,$$ we mean that there is a constant $C$, depending on nothing but $p_1, \ldots, p_k$, such that $A \leq CB$.
--------------------------------------------------
[70.17%] Let c be t(8).
--------------------------------------------------
[70.07%] Let p(c) = 8*c**2.
--------------------------------------------------
[70.04%] Moreover, $geo_{\mathcal{L}(G)}\left(0\right)=alg_{\mathcal{L}(G)}\left(0\right)=q$, where $q$ is number of tSCCs of $G$.

         Because of the large size of the starch molecules, this solution is an effective plasma volume expander, resulting in sustained dose-dependent decreases in packed cell volume and plasma protein concentration with increased oncotic pressure.
--------------------------------------------------
[71.08%] In other words, the more solids present in the filler material, the greater will be the reduction in the total head space volume filled with such material.
--------------------------------------------------
[69.22%] The protein content in the supernatant was measured by Lowry's method.
--------------------------------------------------
[68.59%] This may be explained by the increased adipose tissue in bone marrow during caloric restriction, which contributes to an increase in circulating adiponectin.

--------------------------------------------------
[68.39%] Interestingly, the second highest maximum concentration of starch was also observed in Hyb 8 suggesting that there may be a trade‐off between soluble sugars and starch.

[67.49%] Clearances of inulin and PAH decreased progressively after CsA dosage while renal vascular resistance increased.
--------------------------------------------------
[67.38%] The large decrease in the proper density caused by the expansion of the Universe also results in a large drop in the pressure and a large increase in the entropy.

[67.34%] Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a concentration of 1 × 10^6^/ml.
--------------------------------------------------
[67.26%] In addition to probing the interplay between the supersaturation-generation rates and total doses in ASDs based on insoluble hydrogel carriers, our results further support the fact that through either increasing the hydrogel-particle size or lowering the total dose to achieve maximum supersaturation still below the critical-supersaturation level, it is possible to avoid drug precipitation so as to maintain sustained supersaturation.Q:
--------------------------------------------------
[67.25%] Our results show clearly for the first time that by using the smallest-particle-size fraction and a high dose (i.e., above the critical dose), it is indeed possible to significantly shorten the duration of sustained supersaturation in the kinetic-solubility profile of an ASD based on a water-insoluble hydrogel carrier, such that it resembles the spring-and-parachute dissolution profiles normally associated with ASDs based on soluble carriers.

--------------------------------------------------
[68.47%] Perhaps he thought that I had decoyed him
--------------------------------------------------
[68.21%] 'How did he find out?'
--------------------------------------------------
[68.15%] In the course of the investigation the


         As line bundles on curves lift, we can find a lift of ${{\mathcal O}}_E(O_E)$ which in turn allows us to construct a lift ${{\mathcal M}}_{E,W}$ to $W$ of the Mumford line bundle ${{\mathcal M}}_E$ (*cf*.
--------------------------------------------------
[71.59%] It will be convenient for us to extend these definitions to $\mathbf{Q}$-line bundles using the relation $$F(V,L^r,\alpha) = r^n F(V,L,\alpha),$$ which the reader can readily verify.
--------------------------------------------------
[69.98%] Let $\tilde{{\Delta}}_{t_j}= \Pi^{-1}({\Delta}_{t_j})$ be the corresponding ramified lifts to ${\mathbb C\mathbb P}_1\times {\mathbb C\mathbb P}_1$.
--------------------------------------------------
[69.73%] We furthermore choose a complex line bundle $L\to S^1\times S^1$ with a metric $h^L$ and connection $\nabla^L$ such that $\int_{S^1\times S^1/S^1} c_1(\nabla^L)$ is the normalized volume form ${{\tt vol}}_{S^1}$ of $S^1$.
--------------------------------------------------
[68.15%] By this assumption we can find $K$ defined on the $k-1$-skeleton such that ${{\bf o}}^k(F,K)=0$.
--------------------------------------------------
[67.12%] The underyling fibre bundle is ${{\tt pr}}_2:S^1\times S^1\to S^1$.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.90%] In fact, homotopic pairs define the same lifts $[F_{|X^*},K]\in K(X^{*},X^{*-1})$.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.50%] In fact, we can consider the pair $(F_{|X^{2p}},K)$ as a choice of a lift of $\psi_{|X^{2p}}\in K^0(X^{2p})$ to a class $[F_{|X^{2p}},K]\in K^0(X^{2p},X^{2p-1})$.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.37%] We define the curves on $Y$ as follows: $$e:=\pi(E) \ \ \ \text{and} \ \ \ f:= \pi(F) .
--------------------------------------------------
[66.07%] Let now ${\mathcal{E}}_{geom}$ be a reduced geometric family with closed odd-dimensional fibers.

--------------------------------------------------
[65.73%] 3.  We have $\Omega({\mathcal{E}}^{op}_{geom})=-\Omega({\mathcal{E}}_{geom})$.
--------------------------------------------------
[65.67%] Similarly, $W^u({{\rm\bf w}})$ meets ${{\text{In}}}({{\rm\bf v}})$ on a closed curve — this is the expected unfolding from the coincidence of the invariant manifolds at $\lambda=0$.
--------------------------------------------------
[65.56%] Since $C$ is an initial segment of $F$, if $p\in F\setminus C$ with $p\vee\left(\bigvee C\right) <\infty$, then $p\not\leq \bigvee C$, and so $\left(\bigvee C\right)^{-1}\left(p\vee \left(\bigvee C\right)\right)\neq e$.
--------------------------------------------------
[65.46%] If $F:B\rightarrow U(n)$ represents $[F]\in K^1(B)$, then we define the bundle $V_F$ over $S^1\times B$ as in \[eufiewfewfew\].

[65.43%] \[prop:curvcalc0\] Let $G=(V,E)$ be a $D$-regular graph and $e = \{x,y\} \in E$ an edge.

         The key idea is that Permutation.next() yields all permutations of the items in _data that begin with _sofar.

[62.80%] After feeding it a starter sequence, it will output a probabilities for the next characters in the sequence.
--------------------------------------------------
[62.59%] A breadth first traversal comes to mind, but I can't quite get the data
--------------------------------------------------
[62.27%] Presumably there is something like return data[start_index + 3:end_index] as a next line, in which case using if start_index > -1: instead of the while statement would have been far more readable.
--------------------------------------------------
[61.59%] Taking the limit as $n\to\infty$ yields
--------------------------------------------------
[61.52%] What is next in 111, 108, 113, 132, 171, 236, 333?
--------------------------------------------------
[60.60%] What is next in 33, 66, 95, 120, 141, 158, 171?

[60.03%] What comes next: 195, 197, 199, 201, 203?
--------------------------------------------------
[59.89%] One main concern in this context is whether $X_{n}\rightarrow \infty $ with probability (wp) $1$ (a case of transience) or to some limiting random variable (rv) $X_{\infty }$ (a case of recurrence): the tails of $\nu $ matter to decide.
--------------------------------------------------
[59.77%] What comes next: -16, -36, -64, -94, -120, -136, -136?

         The present invention employs a different approach and uses a piezoelectric polymer film supported above the screen for selective localized depression towards the screen.
--------------------------------------------------
[73.96%] The display apparatus includes a touch panel provided with a touch switch and a piezoelectric actuator mechanically connected to the touch panel.
--------------------------------------------------
[69.46%] Unlike the first-generation model, which worked with a combination of projectors, the newer model uses a flat-screen panel from Samsung that can be used horizontally, or mounted vertically on walls.
--------------------------------------------------
[68.98%] Category:Multi-purpose stadiums in ThailandJapanese Patent Application Publication No. 2006-215738 (JP2006-215738A) discloses a display apparatus with a touch panel using a piezoelectric actuator.
--------------------------------------------------
[68.57%] (c) -2/7This invention relates to an improved display device utilizing electrochromic phenomenon.
--------------------------------------------------
[68.16%] Thin-film transistors are used for fabricating displays.
--------------------------------------------------
[68.10%] A further object of the invention is to provide a slide projector which can accept conventional magazines or trays.
--------------------------------------------------
[67.60%] An additional object of the invention is to provide the slide projector with a novel and improved prime mover for the slide changer.
--------------------------------------------------
[67.46%] As an alternative method of reducing reflections, surface panels on the object could also be physically tilted or otherwise physically modified as directed by the processing unit to redirect and minimize especially noticeable specular reflection.
--------------------------------------------------
[67.22%] This invention relates generally to devices for projecting pictures onto large viewing screens; and more particularly to such devices that project laser beams via reflective liquid-crystal light valves to form such pictures.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.85%] BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to projectors for photographic transparencies, commonly known as slide projectors, and more particularly to improvements in socalled universal projectors which can be used for presentation of differently dimensioned slides.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.57%] The first person slides the squeegee, which can be 3 to 3.5 meters long, into the cylindrical screen from one side.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.00%] The present invention has been made in consideration of the above situation, and has as its object to provide a magnetoresistive film which reduces the switching field of a perpendicular magnetization film and is easy to form without decreasing the yield or greatly increasing the cost, and a memory requiring only small power consumption.
--------------------------------------------------
[65.76%] Another object of the invention is to provide a novel housing for use in a slide projector of the just outlined character and to provide the housing with guide means capable of accepting, supporting and guiding magazines or trays for differently dimensioned slides.
--------------------------------------------------
[65.53%] Besides AMOLED displays have a much wider viewing angle.
--------------------------------------------------
[65.50%] Such a structure is employed to reduce a dark current component and it is becoming possible to achieve a high-quality image.
--------------------------------------------------
[65.47%] A second approach is to change the composition of the backing layer by using a mixture of different and higher molecular weight polymers from the same family of hydroxyethyl and hydroxypropyl celluloses.

         The parties to the Cibulskis lawsuit spent the next few years conducting discovery and preparing for trial.
--------------------------------------------------
[100.00%] The parties to the Cibulskis lawsuit spent the next few years conducting discovery and preparing for trial.
--------------------------------------------------
[68.56%] The first letter, dated February 15, 1993, asked the attorney to accept the Cibulskis' offer to settle the case for $5.5 million, because they planned to seek punitive damages at trial which, if awarded, might be much higher than the current settlement offer.[2]
--------------------------------------------------
[68.27%] In two pretrial reports, Maryland's trial attorney recommended that the Cibulskis' case be settled for approximately $1.5 to $2 million.
--------------------------------------------------
[65.01%] Mobil hired its own attorney for the Cibulskis lawsuit on March 24, 1992, who filed a complaint against Maryland, Northern, and B.M.W. in chancery, seeking a declaration that the insurance policies provided full coverage to Mobil as an additional insured, and obligated the above-named defendants to indemnify Mobil in the Cibulskis lawsuit.
--------------------------------------------------
[64.79%] Mobil's attorney continued to prepare for trial.
--------------------------------------------------
[63.59%] On July 30 and August 23, 1993, Mobil sent letters to Maryland's attorneys in the declaratory judgment action, warning that Mobil would sue Maryland for any amount awarded to the Cibulskis that exceeded the policy limits.

--------------------------------------------------
[62.67%] The plaintiff's attorney showed Consoli numerous CPSC reports at trial.
--------------------------------------------------
[62.66%] A trial caudal block was planned.
--------------------------------------------------
[62.43%] Years after those issues first arose, courts are still grappling with them on a case-by-case basis, legal experts say.
--------------------------------------------------
[62.43%] They and their spouses filed suit against Mobil in the circuit court of Cook County, No. 90-L-3410 (Cir. Ct. Cook Co.) (Cibulskis lawsuit).

         The same arguments as in the proof of Theorem \[equivTh\] apply, and give a bundle isomorphism $\Phi: p^{-1}(U)\to  p^{-1}(V)$, where $U$, $V$ are open neighborhoods of $x$, and the induced map $s:U\to V$ is an isometry.
--------------------------------------------------
[73.57%] 1.  If $U\subseteq B$ is open, then $\Omega({\mathcal{E}}_{geom|U})=\Omega({\mathcal{E}}_{geom})_{|U}$.
--------------------------------------------------
[72.00%] The theorem states that if a set of points is mapped onto another set , such that two points in are closer than some prescribed fixed distance if and only if the corresponding points in are closer than some, in general different, prescribed fixed distance, then both sets are homeomorphic, i.e., identical up to a continuous change in the coordinate system.
--------------------------------------------------
[71.27%] If $F:B\rightarrow U(n)$ represents $[F]\in K^1(B)$, then we define the bundle $V_F$ over $S^1\times B$ as in \[eufiewfewfew\].
--------------------------------------------------
[71.24%] (Apply Theorem \[Symb.Pow.Thm\] to the homogeneous ideal $I$ of $T$.)
--------------------------------------------------
[70.89%] Then there exists an isomorphism of vector spaces (i.e. a bijective $\mathbb{R}$-linear map) $\phi: V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n$ for some $n\in \mathbb{N}$.
--------------------------------------------------
[70.88%] We deduce that $\rho_\bullet^*$ is indeed an isomorphism of Jacobian varieties ${{\rm Jac}}(X_1) \times \cdots \times {{\rm Jac}}(X_n) \simeq {{\rm Jac}}(X)$.
--------------------------------------------------
[70.46%] Then there exist uncountably many $\xi \in \lF _q((T^{-1}))$ such that $$w_1(\xi )=w_1 ^{*}(\xi )=\ldots =w_d(\xi )=w_d ^{*}(\xi )=w.
--------------------------------------------------
[69.91%] Similarly, $W^u({{\rm\bf w}})$ meets ${{\text{In}}}({{\rm\bf v}})$ on a closed curve — this is the expected unfolding from the coincidence of the invariant manifolds at $\lambda=0$.
--------------------------------------------------
[69.90%] I cannot manage to understand the proof of the theorem below, could you elaborate why the maps agree on the basis vectors in $R^3$?
--------------------------------------------------
[69.83%] It will be convenient for us to extend these definitions to $\mathbf{Q}$-line bundles using the relation $$F(V,L^r,\alpha) = r^n F(V,L,\alpha),$$ which the reader can readily verify.
--------------------------------------------------
[69.79%] Therefore, [the induced map $\overline {\pi}: G/\Gamma \mapsto S/\pi(\Gamma)$ is proper]{}, and consequently $$\begin{aligned}
--------------------------------------------------
[69.66%] Thus we can now state the following theorem.
--------------------------------------------------
[69.48%] We require that the fibres $(\mathcal{X}_t,\mathcal{L}|_{\mathcal{X}_t})$ are isomorphic to $(X,L)$ for $t\not=0$, where $\mathcal{X}_t=\pi^{-1}(t)$.
--------------------------------------------------
[69.33%] This conclusion can be drawn from a theorem proved in this paper which states that the recurrence matrix determines the topology of closed sets.
--------------------------------------------------
[69.18%] (i) We apply Theorem \[glm\] with $X=H_{1}$, $Y=H_{2}$, and with $B(\cdot,\cdot)=\tilde B(\cdot,\cdot)$ and $F$ given by and , respectively.
--------------------------------------------------
[69.15%] The transformation into a constant term identity is analogous to the proof of Theorem \[thm:QHTREEConstantTerm\].

         In all this flux there is no definitively adequate method of life and no definitive or absolutely worthy end of action, so far as concerns the science which sets out to formulate a theory of the process of economic life.
--------------------------------------------------
[68.50%] It is human to ponder the finite nature of life.
--------------------------------------------------
[68.35%] Considering that millions of nonlinear biochemical reactions occur simultaneously in a living cell, it is unfeasible to include all kinetic parameters in a writable model.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.29%] There seems to be no sufficient
--------------------------------------------------
[65.71%] It is this difficulty which causes the thought of overcoming mechanization to involve an ineradicable dimension of salvation, of transcendence, even as this process is ultimately centred on the material preservation of life.
--------------------------------------------------
[65.25%] All things in flux, all generated things, are destined to decay.
--------------------------------------------------
[65.03%] As is often the way, what is easy in theory has become unclear and uncertain.
--------------------------------------------------
[64.70%] As far as science is concerned, unless and until somebody providesobjective justification for a designer, there is nothing there.

[64.68%] Bergson's understanding of the mechanization of life as the crisis of modern humanity comes at the end of a lifetime's investigation of the relationships between ontology, psychology, biology and ethics, one whose roots, and continuity, can be traced back to his early analysis and critique of the human tendency to spatialize time.

         In the first case, the information is related to the amount of light that enters the eye, which causes the pupil to dilate or constrict.
--------------------------------------------------
[73.44%] Contrast glare is where one part of the vision area is much brighter than another.
--------------------------------------------------
[71.15%] Usually it is caused by large differences in light levels within the visual field.
--------------------------------------------------
[70.14%] Windows are often a source of direct glare, or one may experience direct glare by looking straightly to the sun or a light bulb.
--------------------------------------------------
[69.55%] Direct glare occurs when there are bright light sources directly in the operator's field of view.
--------------------------------------------------
[68.56%] This behavior can be explained by the dependence of light yield on the nature of the interacting particle.
--------------------------------------------------
[67.79%] In patients with high myopia, glaucoma is an important consideration because of the high frequency of concurrent defects and VF loss close to fixation.
--------------------------------------------------
[67.66%] There are three types of glare: direct, contrast, and indirect.
--------------------------------------------------
[67.48%] The light from the crystal is detected by the array of photomultiplier tubes, which outputs a signal proportional to the energy of the incident gamma.
--------------------------------------------------
[67.46%] Indirect glare occurs when light from windows or overhead lighting is reflected off shiny surfaces in the field of view, such as terminal screens, desks and other office equipment, which is considered to be the most commonly experienced glare and is the one that causes most discomfort to human eye.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.97%] Ideally, a task light will perform two major functions: (1) it will increase the overall illumination level on the work surface, and (2) it will produce a glare-free visual environment.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.96%] The propagation speed of the pulse is $\alpha+\gamma=0.7$ .
--------------------------------------------------
[66.72%] It appears as a red conjunctival mass originating from the stroma.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.51%] When such fixtures are located directly in an angular line with the eye, objectionable reflective glare will be experienced.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.43%] Although this has not yet been shown at the histological level, the elongation of the globe in myopic eyes leads to mechanical stretching and thinning of the retina.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.17%] 1. Exposure of the first individual image (e.g., red).

[66.10%] The amount of visible light that can be directly collected from such a source into an optical system is typically less than a tenth of the visible light produced.

[66.82%] Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion method.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.59%] Plasma concentrations are shown for TC (A), TG (B) and HDL-C (C) of the rimonabant and nontreated mice at week 0 and 4.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.47%] The toxic effect was evaluated in the laboratory bioassay after 24 and 48 h of the application of insecticides.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.31%] Several doses have been used in studies with varying clinical effects.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.19%] The diagnosis was downhill esophageal varices secondary to SVC thrombosis due to multiple prior central venous catheters.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.13%] The severity of inflammation following intravenous infusion of the secretagogue cerulein (10 microg/kg/h x 4 hours) was assessed using a histologic scoring system.
--------------------------------------------------
[66.11%] A few components which can protect different tissues from toxic agents were clinically tested, showing conflicting results.
